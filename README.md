# ðŸ“‹ My ToDo App

Simple and efficient tool to help you manage your tasks and stay organized!

## Brief description
Welcome to my **Final Project** for the Harvard course CS50x. The app that I have created is called *'ToDoApp'*. As the name implies, it helps fellas keep track of the routine tasks. Moreover, it rememebers all tasks you have accomplished, so you can come back to the history and see your path. 


## Technologies I have used

For this project I have mainly used an Apple framework for writing on Swift called SwiftUI. To be more precise, I have used the following things from SwiftUI: 

- SwiftData - for storing Users information
- DatePicker - for picking the appropriate time
- Lists, VStacks, NavigationStacks - for general strcture of the app


> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this app does not send you any reminders (or so called 'Push notifications'), because it requires the Apple Developer account, which I can not but at the moment.
